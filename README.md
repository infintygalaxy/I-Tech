User Registration and Login System
This repository contains code for a user registration and login system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Description
This system allows users to register by entering their name, email address, and password. The registration details are displayed in a table on the registration page. Registered users can then login by entering their username and password on the login page.

The system includes the following files:

registration.html: This file contains the HTML code for the registration page.
login.html: This file contains the HTML code for the login page.
style.css: This file contains the CSS code for both the registration and login pages.
script.js: This file contains the JavaScript code for the user registration and login system.
Usage
To use this system, simply open the registration.html or login.html file in a web browser.

When registering a new user, the user must enter their name, email address, and password. The email address is validated using a regular expression to ensure it is in the correct format. Once the user clicks the "Register" button, the registration details are added to the table on the registration page.

Registered users can then login by entering their username and password on the login page. The system checks the table on the registration page for a matching username and password combination. If found, the system displays an alert message indicating a successful login. Otherwise, an alert message is displayed indicating that the username or password is invalid.

JavaScript Code
The script.js file contains the following JavaScript code:

A variable to keep track of the user count.
A function to validate the email address using a regular expression.
A function to register a new client.
A function to delete a row from the registration table.
A function to edit a row from the registration table.
A function to check the login credentials of a user.
A function to open a new window for the login page.
A function to open a new window for the registration page.
The JavaScript code is extensively commented for ease of understanding.

Note: The user data is stored only in the client-side table on the registration page and is not saved or sent to a server.
